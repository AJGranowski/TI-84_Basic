The programming environment is probably the best part about the TI-84. This repository is a collection of the cool things that can be made with it.

Programs either ripped or written to the TI-84 are stored in a weird format such as `.8xp`. Because the contents of the files are giberish, they need to be doctored to and from source code. To do this, a TI-Basic compiler/decompiler is needed. The files in this repository are meant to be compiled with TokensIDE, but another compiler such as the ones found [**here**](http://tibasicdev.wikidot.com/sk:computer-setup) might work aswell.
